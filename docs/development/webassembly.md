# WebAssembly build (experimental)

The optional `OPENTLV_BUILD_WASM` build compiles the OpenTLV C core to
WebAssembly with [Emscripten](https://emscripten.org/), so browser tooling runs
the same parser as native applications. It defaults to `OFF` and adds nothing
to normal C and C++ builds.

The module provides parse tooling plus owning compiled Query, checked Document
editing and contextual Query Schema validation. It wraps the existing C API in
`bindings/wasm/src/opentlv_wasm.c`; no parsing or Query semantics are duplicated.
The EMV dictionary is available as an annotation module (below). Remaining
public-facade gaps are tracked in the [binding capability matrix](../concepts/bindings.md).

## Build

Install and activate an Emscripten SDK (CI pins the version set in
`.github/workflows/wasm.yml`), then:

```sh
emcmake cmake -S . -B build-wasm -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DOPENTLV_BUILD_WASM=ON -DOPENTLV_BUILD_CXX=OFF -DOPENTLV_BUILD_CLI=OFF \
  -DOPENTLV_BUILD_TESTS=OFF -DOPENTLV_BUILD_EXAMPLES=OFF
cmake --build build-wasm --target opentlv-wasm
```

The artifacts are written to `build-wasm/bindings/wasm/dist/`:

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `opentlv.mjs` | JavaScript entry point (`loadOpenTLV`, `hexToBytes`) |
| `query.mjs` | Owning compiled Query and checked Document facade |
| `opentlv-core.js` | Generated Emscripten ES module loader |
| `opentlv-core.wasm` | The compiled OpenTLV core |

Serve these files from the same directory. With the same Emscripten version
and configuration the artifacts are byte-for-byte identical; CI builds twice
and compares them. Format options such as `OPENTLV_FORMAT_BER` apply as in
native builds, and disabled formats are unavailable to the facade.

## Use from JavaScript

### Compiled Query and Document

`loadOpenTLV()` also provides `compileQuery(text, options)`, `loadQuery(image,
options)` and `document(input, options)`. Compilation and evaluation delegate to
the native C engine. Query and Document accept `ber`, `ber-indefinite`, `der`,
`cer`, `emv`, `nfc-type2`, `lldp`, `dhcpv4`, `bluetooth-ltv`, `bluetooth-ad` and
`fixed`, or an owning `Format` object. Disabled components report unsupported
type. Query's `bluetooth-ad` alias uses strict element framing; container padding
is handled by the separate parse tooling. Writer restrictions of each native
Format also apply to `document.encode()`.

Programs expose `info`, `format()`, `explain()`, `image()`, `evaluate(input)` and
`execution(limits)`. Declare `variables: { name: "integer" | "bytes" | "string" }`
at compilation; bind values with `execution.bind(name, value)` or the `bindings`
option of `evaluate`. Integer inputs accept safe JS integers or signed 64-bit
`bigint`; results outside the safe integer range return `bigint`. Named Tags can
be supplied as `names: { symbol: Uint8Array }`. `program.variables` reports the
native unique referenced variables, excluding unused declarations.

`resolve(scope, name)` can supply dynamic scoped names, returning a copied
`Uint8Array` or `null` for an unknown identifier. `resolve: "emv"` selects the
native EMV registry. `nameResolver({ "scope:name": tag })` and
`definitionResolver({ scope: [{ name, tag }] })` create immutable lookup snapshots;
an unqualified name must be unique across scopes. Checked compilation rejects
resolver changes between preparation and final compilation, including equal-size
Tag changes. Resolver exceptions preserve their original JavaScript identity.

`tags: { id, classOf?, numberOf? }` supplies optional semantic Tag callbacks.
Callbacks receive copied Tag bytes and return signed 64-bit integers. The
nonzero stable `id` is checked when loading an image; capabilities remain alive
while an execution or schema retains the program.

`Format.fixed({ tag_size, length_size, byte_order, element_order, length_scope,
isConstructed? })` owns the complete native Fixed configuration. Defaults are
one-byte fields, `"big"`, `"tlv"` and `"value"`; alternatives are `"little"`,
`"ltv"` and `"tag-and-value"`. Share the Format object between programs and
Documents using the same configuration. Closing its public handle leaves
existing dependent objects usable.

`Format.custom({ decode, measure?, encode?, isConstructed? })` registers native
Format callbacks with owned lifetimes. `decode(bytes)` receives a copy and returns
`{ tag, header, value, trailer?, tagRange?, lengthRange? }`; each range contains
`{ offset, size }` relative to the supplied bytes. The returned `tag` is a semantic
`Uint8Array`, which may differ from the wire field. Native framing validation
checks the layout. Complete semantic Tags are retained until the Format's final
dependent owner closes. `measure({ tag, value, valueSize })` returns numeric
`{ header, value, trailer? }` sizes, and `encode(element)` returns encoded bytes.
During measurement, `value` may be `null`. Supply both Writer callbacks together
to support Documents; read-only custom Formats support Query execution. Any
callback can report a native failure as `{ code }`, or throw its original
JavaScript exception. Callbacks cannot reenter an object using the same Format.

`providers: { num: { id, decode }, ... }` selects callbacks for the closed `num`,
`bcd`, `text` and `date` conversions. Callbacks receive copied bytes and optional
event metadata; return a signed 64-bit integer or a string for `text`. Text
providers require `max_result_bytes` for bounded native scratch. The owning
program retains callback registrations until all executions and schemas release
them. Callback exceptions propagate and reentry is rejected. Loading an image
requires matching provider IDs and contracts.

`execution.feed(event)` accepts canonical `begin`, `element` and `end` events.
For `begin` and `element`, `source: Uint8Array` supplies the complete encoded
element; the owning Format derives the Tag, Value and Source ranges. Without
`source`, supply copied `tag` and `value` bytes. `offset` stays absolute in either
case. After a retained raw feed is finalized, `nextOrdinal()` returns
`{ ordinal, match }` using traversal identity independently of Source offsets.
`finish()` finalizes deferred results; raw events and Reader input require
separate resets. After evaluating a Document selection,
`editDocument("remove" | "replace" | "insert_after", options)` applies edits with
explicit `target_capacity`. Short target storage reports `error.applied === 0`
and permits retry; partial failures preserve their applied count.

`querySchema([{ context, assertion, name }], { format })` owns references to
compiled context selectors and relative Boolean assertion programs. Its
`validateBuffer` and `validateDocument` methods accept depth/node/work/context
and snapshot limits. Errors own rule, Query and Schema diagnostic context.
Close the schema when finished. Document mutation and close are rejected while
provider callbacks inspect it.

An execution owns its native workspace. `setInput(input, { discard, final })`
copies and retains input windows until `reset()` or `close()`; original source
offsets survive legal continuation. `next()` returns a copied match or `null`
at final exhaustion; needing input raises `QueryError` with the native status.
`visit(callback)` stops when the callback returns `false` and resumes on the next
call. Callback exceptions invalidate the execution until reset; reentrant calls
on that execution are rejected. Scalars use `finish()` then `result()`; `info`
reports native validation and resource coverage. Explicit limits include
`max_depth`, `max_nodes` and `max_work`.
Reader failures preserve copied field offsets, Tag and raw length in
`error.query.reader`; expected/actual text, path and diagnostic context appear
once in `error.query.diagnostic`, shared with any `codec_detail`.

`new V1Query("70/5A")` exposes bounded legacy parsing, `format()`, copied `steps`,
`evaluate(input, options)` and a native preorder matcher. `matcher()` creates an
independent owner; feed every Tag and depth with `feed(tag, depth)`, and call
`reset()` before starting a new traversal. An independent matcher remains valid
after the original Query closes.

`evaluateDocument(document, { value_capacity })` evaluates the canonical Document
backend. Results are checked Nodes with `tag`, `value`, `constructed`,
`firstChild`, `next`, `parent`, `setValue(bytes)` and `erase()`. Constructed Nodes
return `null` for `value`. Document edits invalidate previous Query selections;
erased and closed handles raise `QueryError`. Call `close()` on executions,
programs and Documents for deterministic release. Native executions retain their
program and Document owners, while the public facade rejects access after a
Document is closed.

### Parse tooling

```js
import { loadOpenTLV, hexToBytes } from "./opentlv.mjs";

const opentlv = await loadOpenTLV();
const result = opentlv.parse(
  hexToBytes("6F 0A 84 03 41 42 43 A5 03 50 01 01"),
  { format: "ber" },
);
```

`parse` takes a `Uint8Array`, a `format` (`fixed`, `bluetooth-ltv`, `bluetooth-ad`,
`ber`, `der`, `cer` or `emv`; default `ber`) and optionally a `module` (`none` or `emv`; default
`none`) and returns:

Bluetooth modes annotate known AD Types with `name` from the C registry.
`bluetooth-ltv` keeps strict element framing. `bluetooth-ad` adds Advertising
Data container semantics: validated trailing zeros are reported separately as
`padding: { offset, length }`. Nonzero padding is an error at its original
source offset. Neither mode validates schemas or decodes value payloads.

For `format: "fixed"`, `fixedTagSize` (default `1`), `fixedLengthSize` (1-8, default
`1`) and `fixedByteOrder` (`"big"` or `"little"`, default `"big"`) configure the
configurable fixed-width format's tag width, length width and length byte order
(`tlv_fixed_format_t`). `fixedElementOrder` selects `"tlv"` (default) or `"ltv"`;
`fixedLengthScope` selects `"value"` (default) or `"tag-and-value"`.
These options apply only to Fixed. Invalid JavaScript configuration values throw
`TypeError`; invalid encoded input is reported through `result.error`.
`opentlv.formats` and `opentlv.modules` list the modes supported by the loaded build.

```json
{
  "format": "ber",
  "elements": [
    {
      "offset": 0, "depth": 0, "tag": "6F", "length": 10, "headerSize": 2, "constructed": true,
      "children": [
        { "offset": 2, "depth": 1, "tag": "84", "length": 3, "headerSize": 2, "constructed": false, "value": "414243" },
        { "offset": 7, "depth": 1, "tag": "A5", "length": 3, "headerSize": 2, "constructed": true,
          "children": [
            { "offset": 9, "depth": 2, "tag": "50", "length": 1, "headerSize": 2, "constructed": false, "value": "01" }
          ] }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Tags and values are uppercase hexadecimal. Only BER, DER, CER and EMV elements can be
constructed; the other formats return flat elements with opaque values. An
element occupies `encodedSize` bytes from `offset`, including any trailer.
`source` contains absolute `{offset, length}` ranges for `header`, `tag`,
`length`, `value` and `trailer`; empty regions have length zero. The logical
Value excludes the enclosing trailer. Field order comes from these ranges,
so LTV and BER end-of-contents need no wire-framing guessing in the viewer.
The JSON example above omits `encodedSize` and `source` for brevity.

`format: "cer"` uses the generic tree visitor with `tlv_format_cer`, preserving
preorder output and EOC source ranges. It checks framing only; full CER
validation (including string segmentation and semantic values) is not applied.

With `module: "emv"` (BER or EMV framing; other formats report an invalid-argument
error) the result also has `"module": "emv"`. Every element the
[EMV dictionary](../standards/emv/README.md) knows carries `symbol` (the
dictionary name), `name` (a display name) and `lengthValid` (whether `length`
is permitted for the tag); other elements carry none of these.

Invalid input does not throw. The result carries an `error` object with the
numeric `code` of `tlv_result_t`, its `message` and the input `offset`, together
with every element read before the failure:

```json
{ "format": "ber", "elements": [ ... ],
  "error": { "code": 3, "message": "truncated input", "offset": 5 } }
```

`parse` throws only for programming errors (a non-`Uint8Array` argument) or
when memory runs out. Input is processed entirely in the browser. A single
call reads at most 65,536 elements and 64 levels of nesting.

## Documentation playground

The [TLV playground](../playground/index.md) in the documentation site is built
on this module: `docs/playground/playground.js` calls `parse` once and renders
the result as tree, hex and JSON views, with no parsing logic of its own; the
JSON view serializes the parse result itself. The Documentation workflow builds the
module and `tools/docs/hooks.py` publishes it as `playground/wasm/`. To try it
locally, build the module as above and run `mkdocs serve`; use
`OPENTLV_WASM_DIR` if the build directory is not `build-wasm`. Without the
module the site still builds and the playground page says it is unavailable.

## Testing

`bindings/wasm/test/smoke.mjs` runs the module in Node.js and is registered with CTest
when `node` is found:

```sh
ctest --test-dir build-wasm -L wasm --output-on-failure
```
