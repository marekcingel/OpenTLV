"""Shows the one place Python's Writer departs from the C, C++ and Rust
writer: it owns a bytearray it grows as needed, instead of filling a
caller-provided fixed-capacity buffer, so it never fails for lack of space.
It still raises for an error the format itself reports, such as a tag the
format cannot encode.

Run with `python examples/writer.py` from `bindings/python/opentlv`, after
installing both packages.
