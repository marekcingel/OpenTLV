/*
 * Shared infrastructure for every OpenTLV Lua userdata type (Reader today;
 * Writer, Document, Schema, ... later). Conventions established here, so
 * later components add to them instead of reinventing them:
 *
 * - Ownership/lifetime: a userdata never copies the Lua values it borrows
 *   from (a source string, a format object, ...). Instead it keeps them
 *   alive for exactly as long as it is alive itself by holding a
 *   luaL_ref()/LUA_REGISTRYINDEX reference to each one, released in its
 *   __gc metamethod with luaL_unref(). This is the one ownership mechanism
 *   every type uses; there is no separate "borrowed vs. owned" userdata
 *   flavor to choose between.
 * - Embedding over pointers: a userdata that needs caller-owned config
 *   storage for the C API it wraps (for example a tlv_fixed_config_t for
 *   tlv_fixed_reader_format_init()) embeds that storage directly inside
 *   itself rather than allocating it separately, since a Lua userdata
 *   block's address never changes for its lifetime. This avoids a second
 *   allocation and a second lifetime to track.
 * - Registering a type: opentlv_lua_new_type() below assembles a
 *   metatable's __index/__gc/__tostring/__call from plain lua_CFunction
 *   pointers, so every type is registered the same shape.
 * - Errors: never raised directly by anything invoked as a callback from a
 *   C library function (see error.h and walk.c's trampoline for why); every
 *   other C function calls lua_error() directly through error.h's helpers.

 * sets `__gc`/`__tostring`/`__call` to the given functions, each of which
 * may be NULL to leave that metamethod unset. Leaves the stack as it found
 * it.
 *
 * Every OpenTLV Lua userdata type is registered through this one function
 * instead of hand-assembling its metatable, so the shape (which

 * operation needs, shared so Reader (reader.c) and tree traversal (walk.c)
 * produce identically shaped entries. `offset` is the absolute position of
 * the element's tag within the buffer the tag/value were read from.
 *
 * Never calls lua_error(): narrowing tlv_value_t's 64-bit length to size_t
 * can fail (only on builds where size_t is narrower than the value
 * actually read), and this may be called from contexts, such as the
 * tlv_walk_tree() visitor trampoline in walk.c, where raising directly
 * would unsafely unwind through library frames not prepared for it. On
 * failure it leaves the stack as it found it and returns the narrowing
 * failure's tlv_result_t instead of TLV_OK, and the caller decides how to
 * report it.
